# EviveTakeHomeAssessment

Take-home exercise for Evive.  

Created an main Order class that takes in which meal to order for (Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner) and a comma separated list of items to order.

I still need to create tests and a build script for this assessment.  For now, it can be run by cloning the repository and running dotnet run --proj BuildScripts from a terminal.
